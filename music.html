		</div>
		<div class="style">
			Shine is a classic folk tune that was released in February 2019. It is a thoughtful song that certainly warms the heart.
It is not the regular alternative song because the lyrics are so powerful, relatable, and well structured. The chorus could serve as a mantra to everyone, both young and old. The Kind of song that you listen to to get energized and inspired.
